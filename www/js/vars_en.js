var biography_body   = "Marshall M. Fredericks (1908 - 1998), is known in America and abroad for his monumental figurative sculpture, public memorials and fountains, portraits, and animal figures that embody spiritual intensity, lighthearted humor, and a warm and gentle humanist spirit. Born in Rock Island, Illinois on January 31, 1908, his family moved to Florida fora  short time before settling in Cleveland, Ohio where he spent his youth. Fredericks graduated from the Cleveland School of Art in 1930 and then journeyed to Sweden on a fellowship to study with sculptor Carl Milles. After some months, he studied in other academies and private studios in Denmark, Germany, France and Italy, and traveled extensively in Europe and North Africa. In 1932 Carl Milles invited Fredericks to join the staffs of Cranbrook Academy of Art, Cranbrook and Kingswood Schools in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan where he taught until he enlisted in the armed forces in 1942.<br><br>After World War II, Fredericks worked continuously on numerous commissions in bronze and other materials. Many of his works have spiritual intensity, lighthearted humor, and a warm and gentle humanist spirit, like that found in Fredericks himself, attributed to his Scandinavian heritage. In his 70-year career, Fredericks had more than 500 sculpture commissions in diverse settings: churches, parks, schools, hospitals, libraries, corporate offices, embassies, museums, zoos and royal palaces. Among his best known works are the Expanding Universe Fountain at the Department of State Building in Washington, D.C.; Freedom of the Human Spirit in Flushing Meadows, Corona Park in New York, commissioned for the 1964 World's Fair; Christ on the Cross at the National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods in Indian River, Michigan; and God on the Rainbow, a six-story tall fountain on the waterway into central Stockholm that he was commissioned to complete following the death of his mentor, sculptor Carl Milles. Two of his monuments, Cleveland War Memorial: Fountain of Eternal Life and The spirit of Detroit, have become treasure icons of these two cities.<br><br>Fredericks's artistic and humanitarian achievements were widely recognized. He received six Bronze Stars for his service in World War II, including a merit citation for developing a new type of map for pilots to interpret the emerging radar technology. He received honors from the National Sculpture Society, American Institute of Architects, and the Architectural League of New York. He also was recognized with the Medal of Honor from the Netherlands and knighted by the Kings of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, those countries' highest civilian awards.";

var history_body = "Honey (Dorothy) Doan Arbury studied under Marshall Fredericks when she attended Kingswood School at the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in the 1930s. Fredericks and Arbury reconnected in the 1970s through her uncle, Alden B. Dow, a prominent architect in Midland, Michigan, with whom Fredericks worked on architectural sculpture projects. Mrs. Arbury served on the founding Board of Control of Saginaw Valley College, which later became SVSU. She remained active on the Board of Control and the SVSU Foundation for more than three decades. She and her husband Ned became friends with Marshall and his wife Rosalind, and together they created a plan for a permanent exhibit of Fredericks's work in a large gallery adjacent to the Universities Arbury Fine Arts Center, which is dedicated to the visual and performing arts.<br><br>The Arbury Fine Arts Center and the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Gallery was opened to the public in May 1988. Fredericks Himself oversaw the permanent installation of more than two hundred plaster and bronze models in the gallery. Through the years, private donors have made it possible for more than a dozen bronze casts to be made for the Jo Anne and Donald Petersen Sculpture Garden. Fredericks gave the balance of his collection to SVSU in 1994.<br><br>After Fredericks's death in 1998, the University received his remaining tools, equipment, architectural site models, sculptures, and personal and business papers, which form the basis of an important archive for scholarly use at the Museum. With the growth of the collection and an expanded outreach program, the Board of Advisors elevated the gallery to museum status in 1999.<br><br>In October 2003, a $2.5 million Phase II Capital Campaign expansion nearly doubled the Museum's size, adding the Sculptor's Studio, a classroom, archive and research reading room, two temporary exhibition galleries, office space, and a museum store.<br><br>In 2013, the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum was granted accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums, an important distinction that acknowledges the Museum's implementation of the highest industry standards and achievements of significant impact.<br><br>Authorized by the Museum's strategic plan, the Jo Anne and Donald Petersen Sculpture Garden and an exterior entrance to the north side of the building were completed in September 2013, elevating and enhancing the visitors experience at the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum. Generous gifts from numerous donors made this latest expansion possible.";

var me_1_body  = "Marshall Fredericks created this sculpture of a chimpanzee deep in thought at the request of George Booth, the founder of the Cranbrook Educational Community, where Fredericks taught for ten years. <br><br>One day, Booth came to Fredericks and said, “Marshall, I want you to do a Thinker to put on the steps of the Cranbrook museum. Every museum has a Thinker in front.  We should have one.” <br><br>You may be familiar with Auguste Rodin’s renowned Thinker, a cast of which is on the steps of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Fredericks tried sculpting several different human figures, but of course, to copy Rodin's Thinker in any form was unconceivable. He worked on the project for about a month, but was unable to come up with the right Thinker for the new art museum. <br><br>A short time later, Mr. Booth came to Fredericks’s studio and saw a chimpanzee he was carving in his spare time and said, “This is my Thinker. He’s probably thinking far more interesting thoughts than we are. I’ll take it.” It’s still there today, on the steps of the Cranbrook Art Museum, carved in black granite.<br><br>Unlike Rodin’s heroic male nude that looks downward, Fredericks’s Thinker looks outward toward the horizon with an affectionate gaze and warm, soulful eyes. The sculpture’s compact composition suggests reflection and deep thought. The knees have Fredericks’s signature tear-drop shape style element which is found on many of his animal sculptures. A warm brown patina adds a sense of realism to the chimpanzee.";

var me_2_title = "The Lion and Mouse";
var me_2_info  = "(1957) | Plaster Original";
var me_2_body  = "Most of us are familiar with Aesop's fable of the Lion and the Mouse, where the tiny mouse whose life was spared by the ferocious lion, returns the king of the jungle's kindness by saving him from a hunter's snare. <br><br>Inspired by this timeless tale and its moral of ”Little friends may prove great friends”, Marshall Fredericks created a whimsical representation of the fable for the 1957 opening of the Eastland Shopping Center in Harper Woods, Michigan. This sculpture illustrates the final moment of the story, where the lion and the mouse have become friends. Commissioned by the J.L. Hudson Company, Fredericks designed the sculpture to appeal to children. Both animals possess human-like features and warm expressions. <br><br>In its original form, the nine-foot reclining lion is carved from limestone and features a large round head with stylized ringlets. Atop the lion's paw is the six-inch mouse cast from gilt bronze and gold-plated. It is this tiny mouse that attracted a great deal of attention during the late 1950s and ‘60s due to its propensity to disappear. Unfortunately, these recurring vanishings were due to local pranksters who coveted the mouse for its shiny gold plating. <br><br>No records exist as to how many times the mouse was stolen, but the mall went through the six mice Fredericks originally delivered with the sculpture as well as several additional ones. In order to dissuade potential thieves, Eastland instituted several security measures including hacksaw tests on the connecting rod and regular rounds by patrolmen. <br><br>In 2007, the mystery of the mouse was solved when the 15-year old boy who stole the original mouse shortly after the mall opened, returned it after a fifty-year absence, just in time for Eastland Mall’s official 50th anniversary celebration. The mouse now resides at the Detroit Historical Museum.<br><br>A full-scale bronze of The Lion and Mouse is located outside the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum in the Jo Anne and Donald Petersen Sculpture Garden."

var me_3_body  = "The erection of The Spirit of Detroit at the City-County Building (now Coleman A. Young Municipal Center) in 1958 marked the formal completion of the structure whose construction began in 1951. Located in front of a white marble wall at the entrance to the building, the sculpture depicts the cultural and religious spirit of the Detroit community. At the time, The Spirit of Detroit was said to be the largest sculpture cast in Europe since the Renaissance period (1400 – 1600). It stands sixteen feet high and twenty-two feet across from fingertip to fingertip.<br><br>On the Vermont marble wall behind the figure are the official seals of Wayne County, Michigan and the City of Detroit. Engraved on the wall is a verse from II Corinthians: “Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.” Designed to continue the thought indicated in the inscription on the wall, the sculpture is in the form of a kneeling man with outstretched arms. In his right hand he holds a father, mother and child representing family, which, according to Fredericks, is “probably the noblest human relationship.” In his left hand, the figure bears a sphere with rays emanating from it signifying deity. Fredericks chose the sphere because it is an object complete in itself with no beginning and no end. <br><br>This sculpture took Fredericks four years to complete and meant a great deal to the artist, who remarked at its dedication, “I pray only that this work in some small way inspire[s] those who see it.” Fredericks appears to have gotten his wish as the citizens of Detroit immediately embraced this giant figure as the city’s cultural icon by giving it the affectionate nickname, “The Jolly Green Giant.” <br><br>So beloved is The Spirit of Detroit by city residents that they are even concerned about his love life. One night in the Spring of 1965, local pranksters used latex paint and wood and foam-rubber cutouts to create giant green footprints leading from The Spirit of Detroit to Step of the Dance, a nude female sculpture located directly across the street at the One Woodward building. Whether the two sculptures hit it off is unknown.";

var me_4_body  = "In 1946, the archdiocese of Grand Rapids, Michigan opened a new church in the Indian River area of northern Michigan. Although the local congregation consisted of only twelve families, the Diocese recognized the need to service the large number of Catholics who vacationed in the region during the summer months.  Following the appointment of Fr. Charles Brophy as the first pastor, plans began to take shape for a shrine that would attract tourists from throughout the country. Inspired by the church’s woodland setting, Fr. Brophy envisioned an indoor church for residents and an open-air church for summer visitors. <br><br>The archdiocese commissioned prominent architect Alden B. Dow to design the church. At the longhouse-style church’s dedication in 1950, Fr. Brophy announced plans for a Calvary Hill with a large wooden cross. In order to attract the attention of passing tourists, Fr. Brophy decided to erect the world’s largest crucifix.<br><br>After a two-year delay, the archdiocese granted permission for Fr. Brophy to proceed with his plans and construction of the cross’s foundation at the rear of the property commenced. A printing plant owner from Indianapolis donated the enormous redwood cross in memory of his late wife. Erected in 1954, the cross stands fifty-five feet high atop a hill overlooking Burt Lake. <br><br>Considered by Fredericks to be “his greatest challenge,” the figure of Christ took him four years to complete and was cast in Norway. Funded by contributions from over 10,000 summer visitors to the shrine, the twenty-eight-foot corpus symbolizes a Christ on the cross who is still living. Fredericks chose to depict the figure without a crown of thorns or a spear wound in its side. In this design, he “wanted to eliminate the suffering and agony for the observer and give the face an expression of great peace and strength.” One day, discouraged by the challenge and long days and nights at work on the face of Christ, Fredericks came upon a worker cleaning in the studio, on his knees in front of the clay form. Fredericks knew then he was on the road to achieving his goal.<br><br>Since its dedication in 1959, millions of pilgrims from around the world have traveled to visit the shrine and see Fredericks’s work.<br><br>This plaster model of the Christ figure was stored in Norway for over twenty years before being brought back to the United States. Many of its pieces were missing or in terrible condition, so prior to its installation in the Museum in 1988, it underwent extensive restoration. Ironically, it only took Marshall Fredericks four years to sculpt and cast the bronze figure for Indian River but it required nearly twice as much time, seven years, for the plaster model to be repaired. Although it is hollow, the plaster figure weighs approximately two tons and was the first piece brought into the Museum during its construction. The Main Gallery was essentially designed around the height of this sculpture.";

var me_5_body  = "In 1935, Marshall Fredericks entered a national award competition to design a memorial honoring Levi L. Barbour for Belle Isle, an island park in Detroit, Michigan. Barbour, a prominent lawyer who had been instrumental in the purchase of the island as a public park, bequeathed $20,000 to the city for the purpose of erecting some permanent structure on Belle Isle as a “continual hint to [his] fellow citizens to devote themselves to the benefit and pleasure of the public.”<br><br>Open to all Detroit-area sculptors with approved credentials and others with a national reputation, the competition received entries from twenty-six sculptors. Chosen by a unanimous vote, Fredericks’s winning model featured a wounded or leaping antelope which “attempt[ed] to show the beauty in the excitement, or even death, of nature,” according to the artist. Fredericks surrounded the central figure with four smaller figures: a weasel, hawk, squirrel and pheasant, all native to Belle Isle and representing both the predatory and non-predatory aspects of nature. <br><br>Located in the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory Rose Garden, the sculpture stands sixteen feet tall atop a granite pedestal. In its final form, Fredericks altered his original concept but the overall intent remained the same. Instead of an antelope, a wheeling bronze gazelle is the focal point of the fountain and the four smaller figures on the granite basin depict a hawk, grouse, rabbit and otter, representations of the island’s indigenous animals.  At the memorial’s dedication in 1937, Fredericks said the fountain “is meant to express beauty in nature and its creation.” <br><br>Considered by Fredericks to be his “first break,” the Belle Isle Competition garnered Fredericks a great deal of national attention and increased his public notoriety. With more than two dozen castings found throughout the United States and Europe, including his grave site marker in Birmingham, Michigan, the Leaping Gazelle remains one of Fredericks’s most popular sculptures.";

var me_6_body  = "Considered the largest shopping center in the United States when it opened in 1954, Northland Shopping Center in Southfield, Michigan featured the artwork of six artists, including Marshall Fredericks. Commissioned by the J.L. Hudson Company, Fredericks’s sculpture entitled The Boy and Bear was originally outside but was relocated to the Hudson’s department store entrance once the mall was enclosed.<br><br>The bear is carved in limestone with a gold-plated bronze figure of a boy sitting atop the friendly bear. Fredericks’s love for children is clearly evident in this sculpture. The bear’s enormous body compared to the frail boy reminds the viewer of man’s special bond with animals. The bear with his massive head lowered, ears upright, brow furrowed, and gentle smile reaches out to the boy and each viewer in friendship, and appears to offer to lend an ear to listen.  In an interview given to The Detroit News upon the sculpture's dedication, Fredericks stated, ”I gave the bear big ears, big feet and soft forms so he'd appeal to youngsters. I hope when children see him they will imagine themselves riding on his back.” <br><br>Despite similarities between this sculpture and the characters in Walt Disney's movie The Jungle Book, Fredericks disavows any influence from Walt Disney or Rudyard Kipling, the author of The Jungle Book, which was originally published in 1894.  Fredericks said that he simply wanted to make a sculpture of a boy and bear because it would be fun.      <br><br>In 2016, Northland Shopping Center permanently closed. Thankfully, the public is still able to enjoy this sculpture for years to come as the city of Southfield purchased The Boy and Bear from Northland's court-appointed receiver. The city plans to keep the sculpture on public display and has installed it in the Southfield Public Library's entrance rotunda. <br><br>A bronze casting of The Boy and Bear resides in the Museum’s Jo Anne and Donald Petersen Sculpture Garden.";

They make it in response to the influences around them; their environment, the time period in which they live, culture, geography, etc. Marshall Fredericks was deeply affected by the space race of the early 1960s and this fountain reflects that inspiration. This era was a time in our nation’s history when space exploration was simultaneously a dream and a challenge, both innovatively as well as politically in the form of a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to be the first nation to put a man on the moon. <br><br>Commissioned by the General Services Administration for the United States Department of State Building (Harry S. Truman Building) in Washington D.C., The Expanding Universe Fountain celebrates the nation’s first exploration of outer space. According to Fredericks, the sculpture ”represents this age of great interest, exploration and discovery in outer space...[and] the immensity, order and mystery of the universe.”<br><br>The fountain’s enormous central figure, four times the size of the model you see before you, is seated on a sphere encrusted with 5,000 stars, all in their correct celestial positons. In his hands, the figure holds two planets, which he casts out into space. From the spiral orbit surrounding the sphere to the star-shaped water nozzles, the fountain projects a feeling of movement.

Many of these planners, children during the ’39-40 Fair, hoped that the experience would be as memorable for their families as it had been for them.  Dedicated to “Man’s Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe,” the Fair’s theme was “Peace through Understanding.”<br><br>The Fair’s Sculpture Committee requested that Marshall Fredericks submit a proposal for a sculpture to be included at the Fair. Fredericks submitted several sketches and the Committee selected his sketch of two figures with swans. Originally the figures in the sketch had wings, but the review panel requested that Fredericks remove them in the final sculpture. According to the artist, the sculpture “depicts human figures as if soaring in migratory flights with huge swans, an ancient symbol of eternal life.”<br><br>One of four major sculptures at the Fair, the sculpture stood in the Court of States at the entrance of the U S Government Pavilion. This marked the second time Fredericks contributed a sculpture to a New York World’s Fair, as he previously exhibited a fountain at the 1939 Fair. The Freedom of the Human Spirit still stands at its original location in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens borough. <br><br>In 1983, Fredericks donated the design for this sculpture to his adopted hometown of Birmingham, Michigan in honor of the city’s fiftieth anniversary. Erected in Shain Park, the city financed the sculpture through generous donations from over one thousand individuals and corporations. In 2009, the City renovated the park and relocated the sculpture to an area in the center of the park. <br><br>A small-scale casting of Freedom of the Human Spirit serves as the annual Communications Award for the International Center for the Disabled, an organization of which Fredericks was a longtime benefactor.

Nearly five decades later, Fredericks enlarged these seven figures for the fountain in front of Kresge Library on the campus of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. Given by The Josephine E. Gordon Foundation, the Saints and Sinners Fountain was the first major outdoor sculpture on the university’s campus. <br><br>One year later in 1977, Fredericks cast the figures for the Dow Gardens in Midland, Michigan.  Commissioned by Ned and Honey Arbury, these sculptures are in honor of Alden B. Dow, the noted modernist architect.<br><br>Standing nine feet tall, the sculptures before you are in the style of jamb statues often found in the portals of European Gothic cathedrals. Fredericks’s figures are reminiscent of these medieval forms with their elongated shapes and unnatural proportions. Each saint or sinner is individualized with its own unique attributes despite being similar in style.<br><br>From left to right:<br><br>The Good Influence carries a sword in front of her, wears a halo, and is the only figure with wings. She stands poised, yet on guard to abolish evil.  <br><br>Pious Monk/Saint of the Church wears a halo and his hands are clasped in prayer with his head tilted back and looking upward. He has the form of an ancient column, perhaps suggesting that he is representational of a pillar of strength. <br><br>Eve/Knowledge of Good and Evil has braids and carries an apple in her left hand, while her right index finger gently caresses the forbidden fruit. She is forever captured at the moment when she must decide to eat of the apple or not.<br><br>Holy Mother and Child portrays the classical theme of Madonna and Child with a female figure and a young male child, both wearing halos and the child hoisted above his mother’s right shoulder. Like The Evil Influence, the child too holds his arms open in a welcoming gesture.  <br><br>Temptation holds a vertically outstretched serpent by the tail in front of her.  The snake’s head leads onward escorting her toward temptation. She positions her right hand next to her chin, contemplating her situation.<br><br>Warrior Saint is dressed in armor, has a long beard, and wears a halo. His left hand is placed on his beard, his head tilted to one side as he appears to be alert and ready for battle, yet he has no weapon. <br><br>The Evil Influence represents the devil with a long tail and horns on his head. He has his arms spread in front of him in a welcoming pose. He also is the only figure with spikes or flames on his sphere.  <br><br>In an interview with Oakland University, Marshall Fredericks stated these figures “were really rather special with me. I liked the idea of making them tall and thin like columns – almost like trees. And there was the fun of comparing saints and sinners and letting people guess why one sinner is this way and another that way. I tried to put humor in the faces and gestures.”";

A prolific author, he was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature for his lifetime body of work. Admired around the world, Churchill was the first of only eight people to be declared an honorary citizen of the United States. <br><br>Fredericks created this portrait head of Churchill for the Grand Bahamas Port Authority in Freeport, Grand Bahamas Island, a former British colony and member of the Commonwealth of Nations. In this work, Fredericks depicts Churchill’s likeness in heroic-scale, four times the size of life. By sculpting this portrait of Churchill in such a large scale, Fredericks hoped to portray the “tremendous monumentality of the man himself”. <br><br>Fredericks chose to mount the piece on a monolithic native Bahamian limestone pedestal, “symbolizing the strength and solitude of the subject.” The pedestal includes a quote from Churchill, ”If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future,” taken from an address given to the British House of Commons in June 1940 following the fall of Paris to the Nazis.<br><br>Both this sculpture and the portrait head of President John F.

By the early 1900s, medals were viewed as popular collectible items. Relief is a sculptural technique where the elements project from a solid background of the same material. They are commonly used in architectural projects and tend to provide both decorative and narrative functions. Fredericks’s great skill as an artist is evident in these works, illustrating his attention to detail and ability to capture the essence of a subject. <br><br>At the top of the wall sits the plaster relief for Fredericks’s rendition of the Great Seal of the United States, which was cast for the United States Embassy in London, England. Unlike much of Fredericks’s work in the museum, the seal is highly detailed because it is a standardized design. <br><br>First used publicly in 1782, the seal serves as the national coat of arms of the United States. It is officially used on documents such as passports, military insignia, embassy placards, and on various flags. Since the mid-1930s, the Great Seal has appeared on the reverse side of the one-dollar bill. The Seal of the President of the United States is directly based on the Great Seal and its elements are used by several state and government agencies seals.<br><br>The Great Seal features a bald eagle with its wings outstretched and a shield containing thirteen vertical stripes on its breast. The eagle bears in its talons an olive branch and thirteen arrows and in its beak, a blank scroll. The symbolic use of thirteen represents the original number of states at the country’s founding. Above the eagle’s head sits a “glory” breaking through a cloud bearing a constellation of thirteen stars.<br><br>Fredericks also included a polished bronze version of the Great Seal of the United States in his work for the Veterans Memorial Building (now UAW-Ford National Programs Center) in Detroit. It is located on the red granite marble wall at the building’s entrance. The seal was again used by Fredericks for the Birmingham War Memorial originally located at Seaholm High School. The memorial was donated to the city by the Birmingham Rotary Club shortly after World War II. It currently resides in Shain Park in downtown Birmingham, Michigan.<br><br><br><br>Fredericks created the medallion located on the far left of the second row for the Rebild National Park Society. During his lifetime, Fredericks worked with a variety of civic and humanitarian organizations, many of which reflected his Scandinavian heritage.<br><br>Every year on July 4th, the Society holds a festival to celebrate American Independence Day. In 1911, a group of Danish-Americans purchased 200 acres of beautiful heath-covered land in Jutland, Denmark and presented it as a gift to the Danish nation. It has hosted the annual celebration ever since and the festival serves as an expression of the bond of friendship that unites the two countries. <br><br>In honor of the Society's sixtieth anniversary, Fredericks donated the designs and models for the Rebild American Independence Day Medal as a means of obtaining a continuing source of income for the society. On the obverse of the medallion is the Danish coat of arms and the American eagle. Circling these are the following words in Danish: ” Dedicated to the Eternal Friendship of the Danish and American People.” On the reverse is the Lincoln Log Cabin, a replica of which is located at the park, and a profile of President Lincoln. <br><br>Throughout his career, Fredericks created numerous portrait reliefs honoring notable individuals, including one for his close friend and collaborator, Alden B. Dow. A noted architect, Dow, the son of Grace and Herbert H. Dow, founder of Dow Chemical Company, grew up in Midland, Michigan.<br><br>As a child, Dow developed an early interest in design and in the motion and rhythm of the world around him. After attending the local public schools, he began studying engineering at the University of Michigan with the intention of entering his father’s company upon graduation. However, after three years, Dow left the university to follow his own passions, enrolling at Columbia University where he graduated with a degree in architecture in 1931. <br><br>Dow's early work was primarily in the residential field, where he developed his own unique system of Unit Block construction. Guided by the principles of “honesty, humility and enthusiasm,” Dow designed over sixty residences in his hometown of Midland as well as in other parts of the United States, including the entire town of Lake Jackson, Texas during World War II. <br><br>Later in his career Dow designed the Henry J. McMorran Auditorium in Port Huron, Michigan, collaborating with Fredericks on the structure’s exterior elements. Fredericks created the Night and Day Fountain at the front of the building and the Sculptured Clock on the face of the auditorium as a tribute to McMorran, a stickler for punctuality. <br><br>It is through his friendship with Dow that Marshall Fredericks became reacquainted with Dow’s niece, Dorothy “Honey” Arbury, who was instrumental in bringing Fredericks’s artwork to Saginaw Valley State University. She and her husband Ned became friends with Marshall and his wife Rosalind, and together they created a plan for a gallery located adjacent to the University’s Arbury Fine Arts Center that would permanently exhibit and preserve Fredericks’s body of work for all to enjoy.";

Cast in highly polished green terrazzo, a synthetic material made of chips of marble mixed with a clear resin, The Friendly Frog took Fredericks a year to complete. <br><br>Fredericks was able to convey the sculpture’s friendliness in several ways. Most obvious is the smile upon the frog’s face. The frog’s smooth and stylized surface give it clean lines which project a benign quality. Its great big round polished gold eyes are in the form of half a sphere and function like funhouse mirrors, so that when you look into them you see yourself distorted. <br><br>For 16 years, the frog delighted scores of children visiting Genesee Valley who would climb up and slide down its sturdy back. In 1986, the mall donated the frog to the Flint Children’s Museum in downtown Flint, Michigan where it remained until 1993 when the Museum moved to a new location. Unfortunately, the floors in the museum’s new home were unable to support the sculpture’s 6,600-pound weight, which forced it to be put into storage for over a decade. <br><br>In late 2004, the Ruth Mott Foundation purchased the frog from the Flint Children’s Museum and installed it at Applewood, Charles Stewart Mott’s 34-acre estate near Flint’s Cultural Center. The Friendly Frog currently resides at the estate on its own colorful slip-resistant “lily pad” surrounded by beautiful landscaping and water features. <br><br>Generations of children have fond memories of sliding down the frog’s back, whether at Genesee Valley, the Children’s Museum, or at Applewood fulfilling Fredericks’s desire to create “something familiar and happy that children could have fun with.”";

Originally commissioned for a shopping center, the architect rejected the sculpture as too frightening for children. Fredericks adamantly disagreed, stating in a 1981 interview, “[C]hildren love dragons and it's not an ugly dragon, it's a friendly dragon with a big smile and it's cozy and you can sit on its back on those humps on its back. It's just that he never was a child, I guess, so he doesn't know. So they put up a thing, a structural beam thing. I’ve never seen a child near it so maybe they didn’t get the audience that they wanted really.” <br><br>The sculpture was later enlarged and cast as a pair for the Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan. These two are the only full-scale bronze castings of The Friendly Dragon in existence. More than two dozen of Marshall Fredericks’s sculptures grace the 125-acre botanical gardens and sculpture park. Fred Meijer, the institution’s co-founder along with his wife Lena, credits Fredericks with getting him interested in sculpture, “Marshall Fredericks is really the trigger that got me enthused in sculpture. I don’t even know if the gardens would be here if we hadn’t caught the fever.”  <br><br>Dragons were special to Fredericks, whose wife Rosalind equated many of her husband’s sculpture projects to the mythological creatures, “she said that all these things, like all these big commissions which…could kill you almost…have been dragons that I’ve fought against. And in a way that’s really true, they [have] been sort of dragons that you have to conquer and slay one way or another.”<br><br>This twelve-foot-long plaster model of The Friendly Dragon is a recent addition to the Museum’s Main Exhibit Gallery.

They objected to his early sketch model of the fountain’s central figure, which included both male and female nude figures. Bowing to pressure from the group, Fredericks scrapped his initial concept, modifying it to the design we see today.<br><br>In its final form, the sculpture stands forty-six feet tall. Its central figure, Peace Arising from the Flames of War, expresses the main theme of the fountain. The male figure with flames covering the lower half of his body rises from a 10 ½ foot sculptured and filigreed bronze sphere representing the Universe as man has imagined it throughout history. The sphere’s over-all design contains symbols of Eternal Life, Spirit and Dominion derived from ancient myths and legends. Surrounding the sphere is a large granite basin set with bronze plaques containing the names of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. Located within the basin are four carved granite blocks signifying the four corners of the earth. <br><br>As a former resident of the city and graduate of the Cleveland School of Art, this piece meant a great deal to Fredericks, who once stated “I was very proud to have participated in World War II…. I considered it a real compliment and opportunity to do something and the big fountain in Cleveland, which is a war memorial and the largest in the country - it was a great experience for me to do that.

Although approved by the Ford family, Fredericks never executed the design, as fundraising proved to be difficult, causing the project to be put on hold.<br><br>In 1967, almost twenty years after the original proposal, the Inter-Service Club Council of Dearborn revived the project, calling upon residents of the city to raise funds for the monument through public subscription. Unfortunately many Dearborn residents thought that the teenage boy in the model was Edsel Ford, Henry Ford’s son, and not a representation of Henry Ford in his youth, as the artist intended. Although a historically inaccurate assumption, the confusion persisted, causing the Henry Ford Statue Committee to scrap the original concept in favor of a new design.<br><br>Located at the Henry Ford Centennial Library, the final memorial is a life-size bronze figure of Henry Ford in his familiar pose, standing with his hands in his pockets, situated at the center of a serpentine marble wall. At the memorial’s unveiling in 1975, Fredericks remarked “This pose, the thoughtful look, represents him in the best way. I like to see him thinking.” Intended to tell the story of Ford’s life, bronze reliefs depicting his early childhood, adolescence and the growth of the Ford Empire accompany the central figure.

On a simple granite pedestal sit two bronze geese as they take off into flight, suggesting the flight of the soul after death. Beneath their bodies, the tips of swamp rushes bend under the weight of the birds’ wings.<br><br>The diagonal lines of this sculpture echo the motion of many of Fredericks's sculptural compositions. The dynamism conveyed gives this work an uplifting and optimistic quality, which is especially fitting here. The geese are stylized, emphasizing their form and motion as they seemingly soar in flight. <br><br>According to the sculptor, waterfowl are a symbol of eternal life and this sculpture symbolizes “the ascendency of the soul no longer imprisoned by the body.” It is a fitting memorial to a man said to have deeply appreciated nature and “people who worked with their hands.”<br><br>The memorial was later moved to the center of the pond near where it originally stood after thieves attempted to steal the bronze sculpture and sell it for scrap metal.<br><br>In addition to its original commission by the Macauley family, Flying Wild Geese also serves as a memorial to two former faculty members at Alma College. Commissioned by an Alma College alumni committee, the sculpture is set on a glacial sandstone pedestal in the college’s Monteith Library mall.  At the sculpture’s dedication in 1971, Fredericks stated that “the birds in flight express freedom of inquiry and symbolized Michigan and its environment.”<br><br>Found throughout the United States and the world, Flying Wild Geese is one of Marshall Fredericks’s most popular sculptures.

Night possesses long, smooth, graceful curves and floats upon a swan in flight, holding a small bird in her hand.

Fredericks was discharged from the service in 1945 and returned to Michigan where he found considerable work designing war memorials.<br><br>Personally selected by Eaton Manufacturing Company founder Joseph O. Eaton, Fredericks executed seven memorials for the company, to be located at seven different company plant locations. All seven plants where the markers were located have since closed and crews have demolished the buildings. Thankfully, six of the seven memorials survived. The whereabouts of the Detroit site memorial is not known. In 2008, following its restoration, Eaton relocated the memorial you see before you from the Saginaw, Michigan plant to the Museum’s Sculpture Garden.<br><br>In its final form, a marble wall was inscribed with the names of the Eaton employees who lost their lives during World War II, and it holds the bronze relief of an eagle. Visible in the relief is the face, and the obverse of the medallion given by the company to relatives of the deceased. The eagle’s talons grasp an olive branch and arrows, signifying a capacity for both peace and war.  Encircling the inscription on the face of the medallion is a laurel wreath on the left and an oak branch on the right, representing victory and strength.  <br><br>Using the company’s “interfactory” network, Eaton President Clarence I. Ochs dedicated all seven memorials simultaneously in September 1949. The dedication was broadcast to 7200 workers at twelve plants in Ohio and Michigan. At each location, a Gold Star Mother placed a wreath upon the memorial and the general manager of the plant presented relatives of the fallen soldiers with a bronze medallion inscribed with the service member’s name carved around the edge.";

The clowns were relocated near the pond in the Jo Anne and Donald Petersen Sculpture Garden in 2013.    <br><br>Fredericks sculpted the clowns using simple geometric shapes. The forms are highly stylized with clean lines and sharp edges, making them visually appealing. Ranging in height from ten to thirteen feet tall, the clowns’ familiar costume of baggy pants, ruffled neck, and wrist and ankle bands is instantly recognizable. Their clothing is somewhat individualized by the strategic placement of pom-poms. The clowns’ faces are masked by simulated paint and their postures and gestures are very expressive. <br><br>Lovesick Clown grimaces as cupid’s arrow pierces his heart. Acrobat Clown holds the front paws of a small dog on his hands lifted high above his head. Juggler Clown tosses three balls with one balanced on the tip of his nose. <br><br>The Museum’s founding director, Michael Panhorst remarked at their dedication in 1991, “Like all good clowns, they produce joy and sorrow of life’s magic moments. Like all good sculpture, they give shape and form to space, communicating a message in a mute three-dimensional language.”";

Bill Thomsen, the monument’s designer and a former classmate of Fredericks from the Cleveland School of Art contacted him in hopes that he might step in and finish the project. Fredericks agreed to complete the sculpture and began developing sketches of proposed designs.<br><br>In its final form, Black Elk: Homage to the Great Spirit depicts the Oglala Sioux medicine man as he prays for his and all people. He grasps the sacred peace pipe, which was used as a means of communication with the Great Spirit, and points it upward from his heart to the heart of God, gazing skyward with a reclining buffalo at his feet. <br><br>Nearly twenty years later, the sculpture was enlarged and purchased by a private individual. This full-scale bronze casting of Black Elk: Homage to the Great Spirit was Fredericks’s last commission prior to his death in 1998 at the age of ninety. In 2013, the Seligman Family Foundation agreed to place the sculpture on a long term loan in the Museum’s sculpture garden.

Known for their gaiety, mad songs and frenzied dancing, the figure possesses a stout, muscular body and graceful lines.<br><br>In 1938, Fredericks entered the sculpture in the Dance Internationale exhibition in New York City where it took first prize in its division, besting over a hundred works from more well-known artists, including a life-sized dancer by the noted sculptor Malvina Hoffman. Fredericks was elated to capture the top award remarking, “You can imagine my surprise – I entered the Bacchante with no idea whatsoever that it would win any notice. I had given up all hope, secretly, days before the arrival of the telegram.”<br><br>The sculpture was enlarged in 1972 at the request of Henry Booth, son of George Booth, the founder of Cranbrook Educational Community, for placement at the campus’s Greek Theatre. Since a bacchante is associated with the Roman wine god Bacchus, Fredericks did not consider this title appropriate for a work of art that would be placed in an academic setting and therefore changed the title to the less scandalous Persephone.<br><br>In Greek mythology, Persephone was the goddess of spring. Following her abduction by Hades, her mother Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, searched the earth for her, finally finding Persephone in the Underworld. But since Persephone had eaten the seed of a pomegranate Hades had offered her, she could not return to the mortal world. Demeter was so distraught, she refused to bless the harvest and thus the earth remained barren. Filled with guilt, Hades struck a compromise with Demeter, allowing Persephone to spend half the year with her mother in the upper world and half with him in the Underworld. This myth serves to explain the continuing seasonal cycle of the earth, each spring vegetation shoots forth from the ground and then withdraws following the harvest.";

Inspired by this sisterly affection, Fredericks designed a sculpture depicting an older sister hand-in-hand with the younger. Several years later, he enlarged the sculpture with the intention of installing it at the school. However, Fredericks left Cranbrook in 1942 to join the military and the project was discontinued. <br><br>Years later, Robert Grindley and his wife Mary Alice, purchased a small-scale casting of the sculpture for their home.
